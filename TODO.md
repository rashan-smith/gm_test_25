## Semaphore:

1. [ ]  Change from the default daily semaphore to custom semaphore, setting by default two semaphores per day. This will allow us to have better control over the semaphore and to be able to set the semaphore to be used in the future.
Ideally with be good to use a priority or set to store the semaphores and remove any semaphore that was used or is in the past.
